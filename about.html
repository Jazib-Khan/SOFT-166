  <!-- Instructions on how to play the game so that the user can play--> 
  <p>How to play:</p>
  <p>Step 1: Grab a friend</p>
  <p>Step 2: Draw a 3 by 3 grid like the one demonstrated to the right</p>
  <p>Step 3: Understand that the aim of the game is to get 3 in a row of your letter which is how the game is won. This is also demonstrated in the image on the right as player X has alligned itself 3 times in the diagonal direction</p>
  <p>Step 4: Decide on which player goes first and whoever that is draws either an X or O on any of the squares in the grid they desire</p>
  <p>Step 5: Then player 2 draws on the grid with the opposite letter to player 1</p>
  <p>Step 6: Alternate moves from player 1 and 2 until one of the players has drawn three in a row and they're the winner or until no one wins in which all the squares have been used up. In this case go back to step 2 but swap which player goes first.</p>
